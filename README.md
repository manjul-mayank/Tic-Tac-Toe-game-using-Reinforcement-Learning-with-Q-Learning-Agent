# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-using-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Q-Learning-Agent
This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It uses a simple value-based approach to learn optimal moves through self-play. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and provides a great foundation for understanding basic RL concepts.
